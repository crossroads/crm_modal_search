Fat Free CRM - Modal Search
=================================

Filter and search records in a modal window while filling out a form.

- Useful if you have many, many accounts and opportunities,
  and the drop-down list on a contact or opportunity form is starting to be a pain to use.

--------------------------------------------

* Overrides the search method in controllers, adding condition for rendering a modal_search
  partial from the query results.
  
* Adds a javascript hook to each _top_section partial, to set up a mousedown event listener for 
  each relevant select list, in order to fire the modal search.
  
* Adds a javascript hook to each asset show page, prepending an event listener on each
  'select {asset}' link. Replaces the existing search with the modal search,
  which relies on the extended 'search' controller action.
